Project Summary The College is attempting to reduce physical and financial waste of the community by 
eliminating the supply of disposable to-go cups in the Valentine Dining Hall, known as ‘Val’.  
 
Background 
1. Since the pandemic, there has been a noticeable increase in the use of cold to-go cups 
in Val, leading to higher waste generation and financial costs. Moreover, it's been 
observed that these to-go cups, originally designed for off-premises consumption, are 
frequently being used within the dining hall itself.  
2. While the disposable cups are compostable, the composting process itself demands 
effort and energy. Additionally, there's a significant concern regarding the improper 
disposal of these cups, as many end up in incorrect waste categories rather than in 
designated composting bins. 
 
Statistics 
Val currently goes through approximately 2300 to-go cups per day, costing around 300 dollars. 
For an entire school year, excluding summer and winter breaks, the cost adds up to around 
$60,000. The carbon footprint in the manufacturing process is estimated to be 115 kilograms of 
CO2 equivalent. The water consumption in the manufacturing process is estimated to be 575 
liters.  
 
Proposed Plan 
The college plans to eliminate all to-go cups in the Valentine Dining Hall, effective immediately.
